1: sql  isnull(field, replacement)
2: sql select from xxxx x  起别名的时候有意义一点 例如 select * from customer cc , 比 select * from customer a 有意义
3: select a.[pre-confirmed] as preconfirmd (as pre-confirmed will alert error)
4：use ties:  eg: there is a col (1,3,3,2)
  select top 3 order by col group by col (1,2,3)
  select top 3 with ties order by col group by col (1,2,3,3)
