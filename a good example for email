I am pleased to announce the appointment of Leon Kalvaria and Alberto Verme as Co-Chairmen of the Institutional Clients Group, 
  reporting to Steve Volk.
  This is in recognition of their critical relationship leadership across all of the ICG with many of our most important clients, 
  in addition to orchestrating Citi's participation in many strategic transactions and financings.
  Please join me in congratulating them both on their expanded roles.
Jamie
