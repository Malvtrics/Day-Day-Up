7: what does visual studio mean by normalize inconsistent line endings?
  you have endings with something other than a carriage reurn/ine feed pair, It often happens when you copy and paste from a web page
  into the code editor.
  Normalizing the line endings is just making sure that all of the line ending characters are consistent.
  It prevents one line from ending in \r\n and another ending with \r or \n;
  \r\n is used for windows line end pair while \r or \n is usded for Mac or Linux files
