1: in js,string is immutable , (array is immutable , can be changed with index )
2: Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.
3: 1 == '1' true(equal) 
   1 === '1' false(strict equal)(data type)
   Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.'1' < 2(true)
4: switch case use strict equality
