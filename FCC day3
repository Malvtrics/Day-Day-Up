1: in js,string is immutable , (array is immutable , can be changed with index )
2: Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.
3: 1 == '1' true(equal) 
   1 === '1' false(strict equal)(data type)
   Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.'1' < 2(true)
4: switch case use strict equality
5: http://json.org/ (json explanation)
6: js function return everything no definition for return type when declare;
7: {"name":"marten"} hasOwnProperty("name")
   {name: "marten"}  hasOwnProperty(name)
8: Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
9: javascript getMonth 0-11 need to + 1 in some cases
10: Regular expressions => /the/gi
   / is the start of the regular expression.
   the is the pattern we want to match.
   / is the end of the regular expression.
   g means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one.
   i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.
11:/\d+/g (\d)   
   /\s+/ (\s) contrary(\S)
   whitespace including: " " (space), \r (the carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (the form feed).
12: in an object , using this-> public , using var-> private
13: js array methods: map/reduce/filter/sort
    reminder: to filter function -> callback returns true will be kept.
    sort function: sort can be passed a compare function as a callback. The compare function should return
         a negative number if a should be before b, a positive number if a should be after b,  or 0 if they are equal.
